<center><h1> >Press Start< An Interactive Video Game History </h1></center>

Beginning the task of not only creating a hypothetical project idea but also the grant needed to bring it to fruition has so far been a daunting task. However, despite this it’s been one of the most interesting class projects I have gotten to create. While my project has definitely been parred down from the original abstract in order to make it more feasible monetarily I still get to create the core of what was in my abstract. There are many free embeddable emulators and javascript recreations of the games I will feature on my timeline. The more I look for assets the more I find that are free to use with credit to the creator which  will allow me to be more liberal with funds in other portions of my project. With my ideas narrowed down I also have the time to make these portions more fleshed out instead of spreading myself too thin across too many ideas.

At this stage I have three major goals for my project and I want my grant to explain how I’ll accomplish these. Firstly, I want to make a clean, aesthetically pleasing website with a hosting site that will allow me to keep it running for a few years. Secondly, I want to continue to use TimeGraphics to track the history of video games and the companies that create them. And finally I want to add graphics, gifs, and embedded videos into that timeline to make it interactive and interesting to use. Currently I am working on finding a contractible company or person to create these graphics and gifs or how to purchase rights to already created assets.

Research for the project might be my favorite part so far. It’s been fascinating to get to see all of the works and studies people have done about my topic so far. Video games are far from a new topic, the first ever game, PONG, was created back in 1958. But the application of them past artistic expression and into legitimate academia is a fairly recent occurrence. Personally, my favorite thing I stumbled upon during research was a project started by a pair of students, Justin Wingard and Beth LaPensee at Michigan State University. They began to create a video game about video games, exploring the tropes and history of games in a game itself. Their project is similar in purpose to what I am trying to accomplish, but their methods of doing so is what sets us apart. Their project teaches about the history and various styles of video games by letting you play through tutorials of the different genres. Their project is still in the works but their grant funding report has been a great source of inspiration. It feels like I am going through many of the same steps that they are; creating a grant to fund their idea, blogging or posting about the progress, and trying to tackle the very expansive history of video games. Even after I finish my project I am excited to continue following their progress.
