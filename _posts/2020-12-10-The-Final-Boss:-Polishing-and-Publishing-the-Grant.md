<center><h1> The Final Boss - Polishing and Publishing the Grant </h1></center>

The final stages of a project as large as a hypothetical grant are like walking through the final levels of a video game. Despite having leveled up, collected items, and trained for the final boss the entire game no amount of prep can stop the creep of anxiety as you walk towards the boss room. This grant has been pieced together since early November, and yet as I near the final fews days before it’s submission it feels like it’s been days since I wrote my proposal, not over a month. I have learned so much from each step of this journey. Before this project I had no idea what half of the pieces of a grant were, let alone how to write them. Through peer review I was able to learn from my own mistakes and by critiquing my classmates’ writing I discovered how to critique my own. Like getting a game over seeing the amount of corrections on some of my peer reviews were disheartening at first, but also motivated me to try harder, and write better.

Tackling this grant feels like a long, drawn-out battle. It’s all about managing resources, relying on your allies where you know you fall short, and fighting to the best of your ability. Going into this project I considered myself a very skilled writer. I’ve always been able to tackle large projects in a draft or two, and pump out two or three pages an hour on topics I’m versed in. I’m the default editor of my friend group, there's almost always someone else’s paper sitting in my email waiting for me to mark it up, and yet, this project was a daunting task. With five separate components, each with unique purposes, styles, and requirements it feels like five projects in one. 
The enthusiasm and excitement that I spoke about in previous blog posts has not subsided, but my motivation and confidence has been dwindling during the final stretch of this marathon of a project. Writing and rewriting, editing and critiquing over and over again is fatiguing, especially when it feels like there's always another component waiting in the queue. I think this writing fatigue is also due in part to the fact that I am in three other classes that have a heavy workload during this time of the year. 
The CV and Resume deadline fell the day before a presentation worth 30% of my grade was due in another class. At the same time I was trying to edit my Grant Narrative and Budget I was writing over 500 lines of code for a different Digital Humanities class. Even as I write this blog and begin to finalize the pieces of my grant I submitted not an hour ago a 5000 word collection of five short essays, and as soon as I submit this I will be shifting my focus to a 3000 word essay critically analyzing an entire semester's worth of Supreme Court cases to be submitted during finals week.

As much as I love writing, an unsurprising sentiment considering my Communications major choice, when this many papers come due at the same time it becomes exhausting to stare at a too bright screen for countless hours a day. Especially now that all my classes are online I spend nearly 100% of my waking hours in front of a laptop, either in class, studying, writing, or taking what little free time I do have to call my friends or watch a show. I think screen fatigue is one of the biggest obstacles I had to overcome to complete this project. 
In the end, I still am fascinated by this project and I am so happy I got this experience under my belt. Despite the struggles it brought I feel like I have a stronger sense of what my minor is, how I can use it for a future career, and how to prepare myself for a job after graduation. Additionally, being in Dr. Stover’s class was a privilege and one of the best opportunities I’ve ever had. Thanks to her class I am applying to work at the Library of Congress and be a part of a summer research program continuing the project I was introduced to back in October and wrote about in my blog post on The Yellow Wallpaper. As stressful as it was, this project was one of the most useful I’ve done throughout my college career.
