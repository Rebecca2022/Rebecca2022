Hey y’all! My name is Rebecca, but my friends all call me Becca. I’m 20 years old and am currently in my third year at Christopher Newport University. I came to CNU to study Communications and am also double minoring in Digital Humanities and Leadership. As a DH minor this class seemed like the _perfect_ elective for my major. 

Outside of academics, I’m a 3-year volunteer at the [Virginia War Museum.](http://www.warmuseum.org/) I adore cataloging and researching artifacts and setting up exhibits. Digital humanities could go a long way to changing and improving how we experience museums and I love using what I’ve learned to help where I volunteer. One of the biggest projects I’m tackling now is the complete digital archiving of everything in the museum as well as important tags and info to make it easy to use an archival tool to sort, organize, and find items, their information, and where they’re stored

Some other interesting things about me are my involvement in [CNU Tonight](https://www.facebook.com/the.cnu.tonight/) and the [Marching Captains.](https://www.facebook.com/marchingcaptains) CNU Tonight is a sketch comedy club where I am the assistant director and I’ve been a part of productions since my first semester. In the Marching Captains, I do color guard for going on my 7th year. I spin rifle and flag alongside the other 250 members and was lucky enough to perform in the [Chicago Thanksgiving parade](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=747070912460769&extid=mSPQvDUtLHLzsOJv) last year. 

I grew up in Bristow, Virginia, and attended Patriot High school where I found out how much I enjoyed reading, writing, and even coding. After I graduate from CNU I plan to live in Norfolk and work on the media side of a company, as a researcher for businesses, or as a journalist. 

A couple of fun facts about me are I have [two dogs](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5pp2pTFy87nFpHgNA) at home! Sierra is a labrador retriever we rescued a few years back, and Sophie, a brittany spaniel we inherited from my grandmother. I’ve had dogs since I was young and miss them **so much** while away at school. 

I’m also a huge fan of all kinds of music; from indie and folk to hard rock. Recently I’ve been obsessed with three theatrical bands; [Starset](http://starsetonline.com/), [Ghost](https://ghost-official.com/), and [Sabaton](https://www.sabaton.net/). Starset is a retro-space themed band here to “deliver a message”. Ghost is a band full of anonymous members that mimics a dark twist on the catholic church as their stage gimmick. Sabaton is a Swedish heavy rock band that tells stories of forgotten or little-told people, events, and groups from various wars and civil unrest. If you’re into rock or any of the themes be sure to check them out!
