### A review of LastCall360: A digital experience by NHTSA, The Tombras Group, and MediaMonks

Drunk driving is an issue you have likely heard about since you were first taught how to drive, yet, it’s still a problem that plagues the US. NHTSA among other groups and organizations have launched dozens of drunk driving campaigns. LastCall360 is one of the most innovative.Many other drunk driving campaigns come off as either clinical or overly dramatized and both fail for the same reason: It doesn’t feel like something real, it feels _scripted_. The lack of this patronizing tone evident in many of campaigns is one of my primary praises of LastCall360, during the entire experience you feel like the situation they put you in is a completely plausible one, something that at least _resembles_ a Friday night you’ve had on your own and is thus able to reach a wider audience. 

LastCall360 was created in December 2016. At the time Google 360 views interesting new technology, allowing a consumer to interact more with an object, and get a better sense of what it looks like in real life. LastCall360 takes this tech and runs with it. The experience can be done on any internet capable device, and mobile users could use cardboard VR goggles in order to mimic a full VR experience.

Your first moments in LastCall360 pose a simple question, _cocktail lounge_ or a **sports bar**? Whichever you choose, LastCall360 then shows you your drink meter. It shows how much you’ve been drinking through the night. It goes up with alcohol and down with time and water. It also explains a few basic commands. The rest of the experience plays out like a “Choose Your Own Adventure” book.

You can decide to do anything you want; talk with some friends, wander to a dart board and test your skills (and see how much harder it is to win while drunk), play trivia that casually debunks common “sobering up” myths and tells some interesting facts about consequences of drunk driving. The real genius comes from _how_ these choices are shown, and the experiential changes once you’ve decided. 

The entire time you play through this scenario, the use of 360 degree cameras and audio recording makes you feel immersed in the experience. If you turn away from the bartender his voice becomes more muffled, and you may only hear him clearly in one ear, the drunker you get the more unstable the camera becomes, and turning your head too fast makes the screen blur and pulse. Especially when you are able to utilize a cardboard VR headset this experience is very immersive from start to finish.

Speaking of finishes, _how does NHTSA wrap all of this up?_  At the end of the experience the culmination of your choices will determine just how your night ends. No matter your previous choices you’ll be offered **one final shot** before you leave the bar, and can either take it or move on. After that you have one final chance to make the “right” decision based on your drink meter, and common sense. You can drive home, or call a sober ride. If you drive home a cop car will drive near you, and if your drink meter is high enough you’ll be pulled over. It’s a slightly anxiety inducing experience. However, if you were safe and monitored your drinking, called a sober ride, or even stayed sober the whole night, you’ll be fine. You and your friends will make it home safe, text you the next morning about how fun it was, and thank you for driving and being safe. **If** you drive drunk however...

My greatest praises for this project are the tiny details that allow it to be relatable, realistic, and an effective learning experience: your friends getting more concerned about how much you’re drinking, the bouncer kicking you out when you’re too drunk, the impossibility of winning a game drunk. On the other hand a few larger details are also my greatest critique. The 360 tech was fairly new when this was created, and thus even when fully sober some of the images are blurry or low-res. The audio can sometimes lag behind the movement of actors and throw off the realism. Lastly, if you’re kicked out of the cocktail lounge as opposed to the sports bar there is no option to move on. The experience is stuck, with no way to finish the “game” from there on.

Overall, this project is _incredibly_ unique, and effectively uses tech to help solve an issue in a new way that far surpasses other attempts. Whether you’re looking for a teaching tool or just an interesting half hour, I **highly** recommend trying this experience out.
